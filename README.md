# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).
The model is trained on image data to classify digits based on pixel values.

Tech Stack:
• Python
• NumPy
• Pandas
• Tensorflow
• Scikit-learn
• Matplotlib

Key Steps:
• Data loading and preprocessing
• Model training using supervised learning
• Prediction and accuracy evaluation

This project was created as a learning exercise to understand image classification and ML fundamentals.
